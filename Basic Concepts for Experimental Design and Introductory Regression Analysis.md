## 1.1 Introduction and Historical Perspective
Experimental design is a body of knowledge and techniques that enables an investigator to conduct better experiments, analyze data efficiently, and make the connections between the conclusions from the analysis and the original objectives of the investigation.

Experimentation is used to understand and/or improve a system which can be a product or process. Modern experimental design dates back to the pioneering work of R. A. Fisher in the 1930s at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in the United Kingdom, motivated by problems in agriculture and biology.

Due to the nature of agricultural experiments which tend to be large in scale, take a long time to complete, and must cope with variations in the field, this led to the development of blocking, randomization, replication, orthogonality, and the use of ANOVA and fractional factorial designs.

The relatively recent emphasis on variation reduction has provided a new source of inspiration and techniques in experimental design. In manufacturing, this is the ability to make many parts with few defects as a comparative advantage. Therefore, variation reduction has been a major focus of quality and productivity improvement.

Given the historical background, we now classify experimental problems into five broad categories according to their objectives.

**1. Treatment Comparisons**
- Comparing several treatments and select the best ones
- 

**2. Variable Screening**
- Identifying the important variables if there is a large number of variables with only a relatively small number of them being important
- Once the important variables are identified, a follow-up experiment can be conducted to study their effects more thoroughly
- The latter phase of the study falls under Response Surface Exploration

**3. Response Surface Exploration**
- The relationship between the response and their variables is referred to as a surface response
- 
**4. System Optimization**

**5. System Robustness**
- It is important in quality improvement to make the system robust against noise variation
